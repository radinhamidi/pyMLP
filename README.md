# pyMLP
A python implementation of Multi Layer Perceptron
This is a complete implementation for multi-layer perceptron neural networks with following features:
* 2 Gradient Descent Learning Modes: Stochastic/Batch
* Steepest Descent Mode for Training
* Accuracy and Epoch Threshold for Training
* Saving/Loading Models 
* Live Plotting Back Propagation Error in Layers and Accuracy change during train
* Saving Figures
